Creating a GUI for monitoring, and providing parameters graphically:

1. Create a GUI program and launch MPI program usign mpirun. Data communication between MPI program and GUI would be difficult.

???
2. Start GUI as one of the processes. Create two seperate communicators instead of using MPI_COMM_WORLD. Run MPI processes inside the "computing comm" and launch GUI inside the "gui comm". Data can be sent/recieved/broadcast between the processes.
???
	May not be how a communicator works.

IBM
--------
- Set up variables in partitioner
- assign in settings.f90 and setup.txt
	- setup.txt: number of points, ...
- calculate IBM force using location variables
- use it in channel.f90
- update positions in a new subroutine in IBM.f90 and call that subroutine in channel.f90
