Creating a GUI for monitoring, and providing parameters graphically:

1. Create a GUI program and launch MPI program usign mpirun. Data communication between MPI program and GUI would be difficult.

???
2. Start GUI as one of the processes. Create two seperate communicators instead of using MPI_COMM_WORLD. Run MPI processes inside the "computing comm" and launch GUI inside the "gui comm". Data can be sent/recieved/broadcast between the processes.
???
	May not be how a communicator works.
